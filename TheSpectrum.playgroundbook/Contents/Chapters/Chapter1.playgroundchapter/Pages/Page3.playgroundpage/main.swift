 # Masking
 
 Autistic women, unlike autistic boys, are more socially aware and socially motivated to make friends. Masking behavior is used by autistic girls to fit the social norm and be accepted by a group of people.
 \
 \
 Autistic women will adopt personality traits and mannerisms from other people they see are socially embraced.
 
 ```
 "Some people are saying that now that I've been diagnosed I've been acting exaggeratedly autistic... as if that were a thing. What they don't understand is that now I can just be myself, I don't have to act like a Neurotypical anymore."
    -Sofie Ulsig
 ```
 \
 This causes them to internalize stress and may lead to depression.
 
 ## Masking may also delay diagnosis
 
 There have been more studies conducted on women,especially now. Doctors have become slightly aware that autism affects women differently, but there will be many women and girls who wont recieve their true diagnosis.

 # Remember!
 # Autism does not have a _face_ or a _gender_!
 # Autism is a spectrum not a greyscale
 
 ```
 "If you met one person with autism, you met one person with autism"
